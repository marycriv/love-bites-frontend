# README

Love Bites is a dating app for vampires, humans, dhampirs and slayers to find love at first bite.

React front end/Rails back end

To get it up and running, fork both this repo, and the back end repo. In your terminal, "bundle install" and run "rails s" in the backend directory, and run "npm start" in the front end directory. Your backend will be on port 3001, and your front end will be on port 3000.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
